You can use an action defined in the same repository as the workflow, a public repository, or in a published Docker container image (https://hub.docker.com/).\nWe strongly recommend that you include the version of the action you are using by specifying a Git ref, SHA, or Docker tag number. If you don't specify a version, it could break your workflows or cause unexpected behavior when the action owner publishes an update.\n- Using the commit SHA of a released action version is the safest for stability and security.\n- Using the specific major action version allows you to receive critical fixes and security patches while still maintaining compatibility. It also assures that your workflow should still work.\n- Using the master branch of an action may be convenient, but if someone releases a new major version with a breaking change, your workflow could break.\nSome actions require inputs that you must set using the with keyword. Review the action's README file to determine the inputs required.\nActions are either JavaScript files or Docker containers.
