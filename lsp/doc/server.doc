Issues

1) Server did not send correct data format to the client, which is why 
the client did not send a "initialized" request back.

Solution

1) Wireshark: to traffic sniff both correct and incorrect data being sent.

    Sub-Issues
        1) Packages such as "go.lsp.dev/jsonrpc2", did not include jsonrpc2 field, which specified
        the version of jsonrpc2 being supported
        2) Content-length: var\r\n\r\n: format being sent was incorrect. 
            a) Realized it was sending "Content-length: var\r\n\r\n", with quotes and the actaul
                string representation of \r\n, not the hex value which was %0A%0D -> CR LF
            b) converted "Content-length: var\r\n\r\n" into a binary value of the hex value, using
                binaryRepresentation, err := hex.DecodeString("Content-length: var\r\n\r\n")
        3) Missing field in result field of response being sent back to client
            a) Found successful case of initialize response which was:
                {
                    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                    "id": 0,
                    "result": {
                        "capabilities": {
                        "textDocumentSync": 2,
                        "completionProvider": { "resolveProvider": true },
                        "workspace": { "workspaceFolders": { "supported": true } }
                        }
                    }
                }
            b) Which i formated and sent back, think it was missing workspace field values.
