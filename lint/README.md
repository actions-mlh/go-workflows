## explanation

The essential package is provided in `lint.go`, which just provides two functions, `Lint()` and `Spew()`.  `Lint()` is the important function; it will take a filename and a `[]byte` representing an input file, and return a `[]string` where each line contains an error message.  `Spew()` will print the internal representation of a YAML file for debug purposes.

Each subdirectory contains a small package used in `lint.go`.  `workflow/` contains the Go types used to represent the YAML structure, separated into different files for the different possible pieces of a GitHub workflow.  Each other directory contains a small package for linting that section of the workflow, supplying a single `Lint()` function to be called in `lint.go`.

For future maintainers: as you can see, only `root/`, `name/`, `jobs/`, and `on/` have directories right now, and of those only the first three have useful lints.  When extending development, consider making a new directory for each of the other top-level GitHub properties, putting a small package in each, and continuing the pattern already established.  As for the `workflow/` directory, most of the code there is finished, but you can double check that all the data in the YAML file is represented by adding the `-d` flag or running `Spew()`.  The `workflow/on/` directory is most likely to need another look; there are several `interface{}` values that can be replaced with a more descriptive type system.
